# UK Property Data Scraper

This app scrapes data from the UK property site [Zoopla](www.zoopla.co.uk). It allows you to make certain selections such as what city, how many rooms, and your preferred price range. You can then download the results to your downloads folder.

## Libraries
The following third party libraries will need to be installed for the app to work:

1. bs4
2. pandas
3. requests
4. tkinter

## How to use
From your command prompt, once you're in the correct directory, enter `python front_end.py`.
